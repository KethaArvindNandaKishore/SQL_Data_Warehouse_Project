# SQL_Data_Warehouse_Project
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a SQL-based Data Warehouse for analytical reporting and business intelligence. The system collects data from multiple sources, transforms it using ETL processes, and stores it in a structured warehouse schema for efficient querying and analysis.
